# Architecture of OpenClaw2

## Overview
OpenClaw2 is designed to be an efficient and scalable system capable of handling complex operations in a seamless manner.

## Components
1. **Frontend**: The user interface is designed with React, providing a dynamic and responsive experience.
2. **Backend**: The server-side is built on Node.js and Express, managing API requests and database connections.
3. **Database**: Utilizes MongoDB for flexible and performant data storage.

## Internals
### Flow of Data
1. The user interacts with the Frontend.
2. API requests are sent to the Backend.
3. The Backend processes these requests and interacts with the Database.
4. The response is sent back to the Frontend for rendering.
